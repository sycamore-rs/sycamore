## ‚ú® **0.7.0** _(2021-12-08)_

Release post: https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/news/announcing-v0.7.0

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - [Implement `TryFromSegments` for `T: Route`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/281)
    This allows the creation of nested routers. See the
    [docs](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/docs/advanced/routing#nested-routes) for more information
    about usage.
  - [Make parenthesis optional in `cloned!` macro.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/283)
    The following syntax is now accepted, in addition to the old syntax:
    ```rust
    // Before
    cloned!((my, variables, to, clone) => move || { ... })
    // After
    cloned!(my, variables, to, clone => move || { ... })
    ```
  - [Builder API.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/269) Check out the
    [`hello-builder`](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/tree/0.7.0/examples/hello-builder)
    example for more usage details.
  - [Make `wasm-bindgen-interning` a feature.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/296)
    This feature is enabled by default but can be opted-out which would disable
    `wasm-bindgen/enable-interning`. Opting-out can lead to a slight decrease in binary size at the
    cost of performance.
  - [Introduce `render_get_scope` function.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/303) This
    allows accessing (and disposing of) the `ReactiveScope` created by the render function.
  - [Hydration support.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/240) To enable hydration,
    replace calls to `render` and `render_to` with `hydrate` and `hydrate_to`.
  - [Add `#[track_caller]` to `use_context`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/306) This
    makes it much easier to debug the `"context not found for type"` error.
  - [Better debugging utilities for inspecting the `ReactiveScope` hierarchy.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/307)

- #### üõ† Fixes

  - [Prevent data binding from panicking when not in browser.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/278)
  - [Extend `ReactiveScope` into scopes that are siblings.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/280)
  - [Fix `Lerp` implementation for integers.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/289)
  - [Fix context API not working through `Indexed` and `Keyed`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/293)
  - [Update TodoMVC example to use context API.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/295)
  - [Remove `autocomplete` from the list of boolean attributes for codegen.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/301)
  - [Fix parenthesizing of expressions in `view!` macro interpolation syntax.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/304)
  - [Fix context API when effects are re-executed.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/310)
  - [Allow constant generics to be used with `#[component]` macro.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/312)

- #### üìÉ Documentation

  - [Add a note in the docs about Trunk CSS support.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/286)
  - [Fix typo in `README.md`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/287)

- #### Internal

  - [Collect code coverage in CI.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/294)
  - [Deprecate `create_root` in favor of `create_scope`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/309)
  - [Fix website npm build script.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/313)

- #### üö® **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - [Refactor `GenericNode` and introduce `Html` trait. Add `IS_BROWSER` constant to `Html`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/274).
    For projects that target HTML, it is recommended to use the `Html` trait instead of
    `GenericNode`. This will ensure that it cannot be used on rendering backends that are not for
    HTML. To check if code is executing on the browser, access the `Html::IS_BROWSER` constant on
    the generic rendering backend. This also slightly changes the `GenericNode` interface which is
    why it is a breaking change but would most likely not influence you.
  - [Make `GenericNode` generic over the event type.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/297)
    The event type is now an associated type to allow rendering backends to use another type from
    `web_sys::Event`.
  - [Rename `Template` to `View` and `template!` to `view!`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/298)
    For most cases, a simple search-and-replace will suffice, replacing all instances of `Template`
    to `View` and all instances of `template!` to `view!`.
  - [Rename `StateHandle` to `ReadSignal`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/300) The
    old name was somewhat confusing and did not reflect that `StateHandle` was just a read-only
    signal.

## ‚ú® **0.6.3** _(2021-10-10)_

- #### üõ† Fixes

  - [Respect basename when navigating using router.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/275)

## ‚ú® **0.6.2** _(2021-10-09)_

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - [Add `GenericNode::remove_property` method.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/267)
  - [Add `node!` macro for creating a single node.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/265)

- #### üõ† Fixes

  - [Do not strip leading `/` from pathname.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/271) This
    fixes an issue with the router on Firefox when navigating to the index page.

- #### Internal

  - [Remove `ToTokens` impl for `TagName`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/273)

## ‚ú® **0.6.1** _(2021-09-25)_

- #### üõ† Fixes

  - [Disable `full` feature on `syn` to reduce compile times.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/245)
  - [Use a global `HashSet` for void elements lookup in SSR.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/246)
  - [Remove part of formatting machinery from `sycamore` and `sycamore-reactive` to reduce binary size.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/247)
  - [Fix panic on updating dynamic node inside a template fragment.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/251)
  - [Implement `Default` for `Signal`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/257)
  - [Implement `Default` for `StateHandle`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/260)

- #### üìÉ Documentation

  - [Update docs to use boolean for disabled attribute on button.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/248)
  - [Add documentation on topological dependency tracking.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/253)

## ‚ú® **0.6.0** _(2021-09-12)_

Release post: https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/news/announcing-v0.6.0

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - [Add integrations for `sycamore-router`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/183)
  - [Added `dangerously_set_inner_html` special attribute to html elements.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/190)
    This allows directly setting an element's inner html without going through a `NodeRef` and
    manually calling `.set_inner_html()`.
  - [Implement `Portal`s.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/209) Portals allow adding
    nodes to elements that are in another tree.
  - [Allow instantiating components with the `Component` trait.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/213)
    You can now also create components that are generic over another component. This pattern can be
    seen in the
    [`higher-order-components`](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/tree/master/examples/higher-order-components)
    example.
  - [Respect base html tag in router.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/220)
  - [Dark mode on website!](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/225)
  - [`create_reducer` hook.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/233) The `create_reducer`
    hook is an alternative to `Signal::new`. It allows you to use a reducer function to get the next
    state from the previous state.
    ```rust
    enum Msg {
        Increment,
        Decrement,
    }
    let (state, dispatch) = create_reducer(0, |state, msg: Msg| match msg {
        Msg::Increment => *state + 1,
        Msg::Decrement => *state - 1,
    });
    ```
  - [Opt out of router by using `rel="external"` on an anchor tag.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/238)
    Adding `rel="external"` to an anchor tag will use the browser's default navigation behavior.
    ```rust
    template! {
        a(href="path", rel="external") { "Link" }
    }
    ```

- #### üõ† Fixes

  - [Fix logic error in `reconcile_fragments`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/180)
  - [Fix grammar on website index page.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/181)
  - [Scroll to top when navigating to a page.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/186)
  - [Use `ahash` instead of default SipHash for better performance.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/193)
  - [Explicitly define MSRV to 1.53 and run CI in a matrix.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/195)
  - [Remove inline JS snippet.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/194) This removes the
    need to load an extra JS file before Sycamore can start.
  - [Add some UI tests for `#[component]` attribute macro.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/198)
  - [Generate a `sitemap.xml` for the website.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/201)
  - [Fix broken link to the reactivity page on the website index page.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/203)
  - [Explain that Trunk needs a `index.html` file in Hello World docs.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/206)
  - [Remove internal `Rc` from `DomNode`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/210) This
    significantly improves performance and memory usage. See the PR for benchmarks.
  - [Optimize the website with `wasm-opt` to reduce binary size.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/211)
  - [Optimize `create_effect`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/216)
  - [Fix `SsrNode`'s implementation of `remove_child` removing two children instead of just one.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/218)
  - [Hold a backlink for each `ReactiveScope` to its parent scope.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/223)
    This fixes a bug where `use_context` could only access the context on the first render and would
    panic on subsequent accesses.
  - [Remove dependency on `chrono`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/224) This was
    replaced with direct access to browser APIs to reduce the number of dependencies and thus to
    improve build times.
  - [Replace internal usage of `.unwrap()` with `.unwrap_throw()`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/226)
    Slightly improves binary sizes.
  - [Derive `Clone` for `sycamore_router` path types.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/232)
  - [Update `todomvc` example with latest features.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/229)
  - [Fix router not actually parsing identifiers.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/234)
    Fixes a bug where a dynamic parameter followed by a dynamic segment would parse as a single
    segment.
  - [Build rustdocs in CI.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/235) The API documentation
    for the `master` branch is available at
    [sycamore-rs.netlify.app/api](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/api).
  - [Reorganize documentation a bit.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/236)

- #### üö® **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - [Extract reactive primitives into separate crate `sycamore-reactive`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/204)
    Reactive primitives are now re-exported in the `sycamore` crate to avoid adding new dependencies
    to your project. It is also now possible to use reactive primitives without using `sycamore` by
    directly depending on `sycamore-reactive`.
  - [Rename sub-module `sycamore::rx` to `sycamore::reactive`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/205)
    `rx` might be ambiguous with [Rx family of libraries](http://reactivex.io/). Renaming to
    `reactive` makes it clear that it works differently from Rx libraries.
  - [Refactored router with new API.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/222) See the
    [new documentation](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/docs/v0.6/advanced/routing) for more
    details.
  - [Support boolean attributes.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/239) Some attributes
    now expect a `bool` instead of `impl ToString`. This also fixes an issue where previously,
    attributes couldn't be removed directly from the `template!` macro.
    ```rust
    // Before
    template! {
        input(type="checkbox", checked="") { "Checkbox" }
    }
    // After
    template! {
        input(type="checkbox", checked=true) { "Checkbox" }
    }
    ```

    [[@lukechu10], [#142](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/142)]

- #### üö® **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - Abstraction over rendering backend! This introduces the concept of `GenericNode` which is a
    trait to access the underlying rendering backend. Currently, Sycamore ships with `DomNode` and
    `SsrNode` out-of-the-box for rendering the the browser DOM and to a static string respectively.
    Components should now be generic over `G: GenericNode` to be able to render to multiple backends
    [[@lights0123], [#67](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/67)]
  - Require using the `#[component(_)]` attribute macro for defining components. This changes the
    component syntax to:
    ```rust
    #[component(MyComponent<G>)]
    fn my_component() -> Template<G> {
        todo!()
    }
    ```
    The `#[component(_)]` macro generates a `struct` under the hood that implements the `Component`
    trait for improved type safety. This also means that you no longer need
    `#[allow(non_snake_case)]` in your code! [[@lukechu10],
    [#70](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/70)]
    [#92](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/92)]
  - Rename `Owner` to `ReactiveScope` [[@lukechu10],
    [#99](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/99)]
  - Renamed crate from `maple-core` to `sycamore` and `maple-core-macro` to `sycamore-macro`. Also
    renamed all instances of "Maple" to "Sycamore" [[@lukechu10],
    [#109](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/109)]
  - Rename `TemplateResult` to `Template` [[@lukechu10],
    [#112](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/112)]
  - Rename `reactive` sub-module to `rx` [[@lukechu10],
    [#113](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/113)]
  - Remove render functions (`render`, `render_to`, `render_to_string`, etc...) from `prelude`.
    These functions are generally only called once in a Sycamore app so they do not belong in the
    prelude [[@lukechu10], [#140](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/140)]

## ‚ú® **0.4.3** _(2021-04-01)_

    }
    ```
    [[@lukechu10], [#79](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/79)]

    most likely be removed in a future version [[@lukechu10],
    [#49](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/49)]
  - Keyed iteration using `Keyed` and non-keyed iteration using `Indexed` which can iterate over a
    `Signal<Vec>`. This is the recommended way to iterate over a list of values [[@lukechu10],
    [#51](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/51),
    [#53](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/53) and
    [#54](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/54)]
