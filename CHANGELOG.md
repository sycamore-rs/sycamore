## ‚ú® **0.6.0** _(2021-09-12)_

Release post: https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/news/announcing-v0.6.0

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - [Add integrations for `sycamore-router`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/183)
  - [Added `dangerously_set_inner_html` special attribute to html elements.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/190)
    This allows directly setting an element's inner html without going through a `NodeRef` and
    manually calling `.set_inner_html()`.
  - [Implement `Portal`s.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/209) Portals allow adding
    nodes to elements that are in another tree.
  - [Allow instantiating components with the `Component` trait.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/213)
    You can now also create components that are generic over another component. This pattern can be
    seen in the
    [`higher-order-components`](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/tree/master/examples/higher-order-components)
    example.
  - [Respect base html tag in router.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/220)
  - [Dark mode on website!](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/225)
  - [`create_reducer` hook.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/233) The `create_reducer`
    hook is an alternative to `Signal::new`. It allows you to use a reducer function to get the next
    state from the previous state.
    ```rust
    enum Msg {
        Increment,
        Decrement,
    }
    let (state, dispatch) = create_reducer(0, |state, msg: Msg| match msg {
        Msg::Increment => *state + 1,
        Msg::Decrement => *state - 1,
    });
    ```
  - [Opt out of router by using `rel="external"` on an anchor tag.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/238)
    Adding `rel="external"` to an anchor tag will use the browser's default navigation behavior.
    ```rust
    template! {
        a(href="path", rel="external") { "Link" }
    }
    ```

- #### üõ† Fixes

  - [Fix logic error in `reconcile_fragments`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/180)
  - [Fix grammar on website index page.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/181)
  - [Scroll to top when navigating to a page.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/186)
  - [Use `ahash` instead of default SipHash for better performance.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/193)
  - [Explicitly define MSRV to 1.53 and run CI in a matrix.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/195)
  - [Remove inline JS snippet.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/194) This removes the
    need to load an extra JS file before Sycamore can start.
  - [Add some UI tests for `#[component]` attribute macro.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/198)
  - [Generate a `sitemap.xml` for the website.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/201)
  - [Fix broken link to the reactivity page on the website index page.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/203)
  - [Explain that Trunk needs a `index.html` file in Hello World docs.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/206)
  - [Remove internal `Rc` from `DomNode`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/210) This
    significantly improves performance and memory usage. See the PR for benchmarks.
  - [Optimize the website with `wasm-opt` to reduce binary size.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/211)
  - [Optimize `create_effect`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/216)
  - [Fix `SsrNode`'s implementation of `remove_child` removing two children instead of just one.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/218)
  - [Hold a backlink for each `ReactiveScope` to its parent scope.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/223)
    This fixes a bug where `use_context` could only access the context on the first render and would
    panic on subsequent accesses.
  - [Remove dependency on `chrono`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/224) This was
    replaced with direct access to browser APIs to reduce the number of dependencies and thus to
    improve build times.
  - [Replace internal usage of `.unwrap()` with `.unwrap_throw()`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/226)
    Slightly improves binary sizes.
  - [Derive `Clone` for `sycamore_router` path types.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/232)
  - [Update `todomvc` example with latest features.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/229)
  - [Fix router not actually parsing identifiers.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/234)
    Fixes a bug where a dynamic parameter followed by a dynamic segment would parse as a single
    segment.
  - [Build rustdocs in CI.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/235) The API documentation
    for the `master` branch is available at
    [sycamore-rs.netlify.app/api](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/api).
  - [Reorganize documentation a bit.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/236)

- #### üö® **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - [Extract reactive primitives into separate crate `sycamore-reactive`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/204)
    Reactive primitives are now re-exported in the `sycamore` crate to avoid adding new dependencies
    to your project. It is also now possible to use reactive primitives without using `sycamore` by
    directly depending on `sycamore-reactive`.
  - [Rename sub-module `sycamore::rx` to `sycamore::reactive`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/205)
    `rx` might be ambiguous with [Rx family of libraries](http://reactivex.io/). Renaming to
    `reactive` makes it clear that it works differently from Rx libraries.
  - [Refactored router with new API.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/222) See the
    [new documentation](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/docs/v0.6/advanced/routing) for more
    details.
  - [Support boolean attributes.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/239) Some attributes
    now expect a `bool` instead of `impl ToString`. This also fixes an issue where previously,
    attributes couldn't be removed directly from the `template!` macro.
    ```rust
    // Before
    template! {
        input(type="checkbox", checked="") { "Checkbox" }
    }
    // After
    template! {
        input(type="checkbox", checked=true) { "Checkbox" }
    }
    ```

  - Cache `window.document` since it is frequently used to prevent going through JS interop
    [[@lukechu10], [#142](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/142)]

- #### üö® **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - Abstraction over rendering backend! This introduces the concept of `GenericNode` which is a
    trait to access the underlying rendering backend. Currently, Sycamore ships with `DomNode` and
    `SsrNode` out-of-the-box for rendering the the browser DOM and to a static string respectively.
    Components should now be generic over `G: GenericNode` to be able to render to multiple backends
    [[@lights0123], [#67](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/67)]
  - Require using the `#[component(_)]` attribute macro for defining components. This changes the
    component syntax to:
    ```rust
    #[component(MyComponent<G>)]
    fn my_component() -> Template<G> {
        todo!()
    }
    ```
    The `#[component(_)]` macro generates a `struct` under the hood that implements the `Component`
    trait for improved type safety. This also means that you no longer need
    `#[allow(non_snake_case)]` in your code! [[@lukechu10],
    [#70](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/70)]
    [#92](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/92)]
  - Rename `Owner` to `ReactiveScope` [[@lukechu10],
    [#99](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/99)]
  - Renamed crate from `maple-core` to `sycamore` and `maple-core-macro` to `sycamore-macro`. Also
    renamed all instances of "Maple" to "Sycamore" [[@lukechu10],
    [#109](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/109)]
  - Rename `TemplateResult` to `Template` [[@lukechu10],
    [#112](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/112)]
  - Rename `reactive` sub-module to `rx` [[@lukechu10],
    [#113](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/113)]
  - Remove render functions (`render`, `render_to`, `render_to_string`, etc...) from `prelude`.
    These functions are generally only called once in a Sycamore app so they do not belong in the
    prelude [[@lukechu10], [#140](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/140)]

## ‚ú® **0.4.3** _(2021-04-01)_

#### Changelog

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - Support `'-'` in attribute names. This makes the following syntax valid:
    ```rust
    template! {
        button(aria-hidden="true")
    }
    ```
    [[@lukechu10], [#79](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/79)]

- #### üõ† Fixes

  - Delete removed nodes in `Keyed` first before adding new nodes and moving existing nodes

#### Changelog

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - Iteration using `SignalVec`. This is more of an experiment and there are some bugs. This will
    most likely be removed in a future version [[@lukechu10],
    [#49](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/49)]
  - Keyed iteration using `Keyed` and non-keyed iteration using `Indexed` which can iterate over a

## ‚ú® **0.3.1** _(2021-03-16)_

#### Changelog

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

## ‚ú® **0.3.0** _(2021-03-13)_

#### Changelog

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - Nested effects. Inner effects are destroyed and recreated when outer effects re-run
    [[@lukechu10], [#29](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/29)]
  - `cloned!` macro for making it easier to clone items into a new scope [[@lukechu10],
    [#34](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/34)]
  - Effects are created inside a reactivity root (using `create_root`). When the root `Owner` is
    dropped, all effects are also destroyed [[@lukechu10],
    [37](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/37)]
  - Nested templates. Using this, it is also possible to build simple `if`/`else` control flow
    although there will be a more polished version [[@lukechu10],
    [#41](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/41)]

- #### üõ† Fixes

  - Parse html root as an `HtmlTree` [[@lukechu10],
    [#25](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/25)]
  - Recreate effect dependencies on each re-run [[@lukechu10],
    [#29](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/29)]

- #### üõ† Internal Fixes and Improvements

  - Remove double boxing of `Computation` [[@Kestrer],
    [#31](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/31)]
  - Create `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` [[@lukechu10],
    [#33](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/33)]
  - Add some preliminary benchmarks for signals and effects [[@lukechu10],
    [#35](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/35)]
  - Add clippy to CI workflow [[@Kestrer], [#42](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/42)]

- #### ‚ö† **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - Replaced `create_signal` with `Signal::new(...)` and return `Signal` instead of getter/setter
    functions for increased type safety [[@Kestrer],
    [#20](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/20)]

- #### üì¢ Announcements

  - New documentation website: https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/ [[@lukechu10],
    [#26](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/26) and
    [#40](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/40)]
