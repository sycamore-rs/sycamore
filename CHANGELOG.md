    template! {
        p { "First" }
        p { "Second" }
    }

    [[@lukechu10], [#142](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/142)]

- #### ‚ö† **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - Abstraction over rendering backend! This introduces the concept of `GenericNode` which is a
    trait to access the underlying rendering backend. Currently, Sycamore ships with `DomNode` and
    `SsrNode` out-of-the-box for rendering the the browser DOM and to a static string respectively.
    Components should now be generic over `G: GenericNode` to be able to render to multiple backends
    [[@lights0123], [#67](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/67)]
  - Require using the `#[component(_)]` attribute macro for defining components. This changes the
    component syntax to:
    ```rust
    #[component(MyComponent<G>)]
    fn my_component() -> Template<G> {
        todo!()
    }
    ```
    The `#[component(_)]` macro generates a `struct` under the hood that implements the `Component`
    trait for improved type safety. This also means that you no longer need
    `#[allow(non_snake_case)]` in your code! [[@lukechu10],
    [#70](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/70)]
    [#92](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/92)]
  - Rename `Owner` to `ReactiveScope` [[@lukechu10],
    [#99](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/99)]
  - Renamed crate from `maple-core` to `sycamore` and `maple-core-macro` to `sycamore-macro`. Also
    renamed all instances of "Maple" to "Sycamore" [[@lukechu10],
    [#109](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/109)]
  - Rename `TemplateResult` to `Template` [[@lukechu10],
    [#112](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/112)]
  - Rename `reactive` sub-module to `rx` [[@lukechu10],
    [#113](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/113)]
  - Remove render functions (`render`, `render_to`, `render_to_string`, etc...) from `prelude`.
    These functions are generally only called once in a Sycamore app so they do not belong in the
    prelude [[@lukechu10], [#140](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/140)]

## ‚ú® **0.4.3** _(2021-04-01)_

#### Changelog

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - Support `'-'` in attribute names. This makes the following syntax valid:
    ```rust
    template! {
        button(aria-hidden="true")
    }
    ```
    [[@lukechu10], [#79](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/79)]

## ‚ú® **0.4.0** _(2021-03-25)_

#### Changelog

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - Iteration using `SignalVec`. This is more of an experiment and there are some bugs. This will
    most likely be removed in a future version [[@lukechu10],
    [#49](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/49)]
  - Keyed iteration using `Keyed` and non-keyed iteration using `Indexed` which can iterate over a
    `Signal<Vec>`. This is the recommended way to iterate over a list of values [[@lukechu10],
    [#51](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/51),
    [#53](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/53) and
    [#54](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/54)]

    [#57](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/57)]

    [#24](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/24)]

- #### üõ† Fixes

  - Add some badges to `README.md` [[@lukechu10],
    [#44](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/44) and

## ‚ú® **0.3.0** _(2021-03-13)_

#### Changelog

- #### ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  - Nested effects. Inner effects are destroyed and recreated when outer effects re-run
    [[@lukechu10], [#29](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/29)]
  - `cloned!` macro for making it easier to clone items into a new scope [[@lukechu10],
    [#34](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/34)]

    dropped, all effects are also destroyed [[@lukechu10],
    [37](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/37)]
  - Nested templates. Using this, it is also possible to build simple `if`/`else` control flow
    although there will be a more polished version [[@lukechu10],
    [#41](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/41)]
