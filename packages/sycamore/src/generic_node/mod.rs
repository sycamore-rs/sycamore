/// Abstraction over a rendering backend.
///
/// You would probably use this trait as a trait bound when you want to accept any rendering
/// backend. For example, components are often generic over [`GenericNode`] to be able to render to
/// different backends.
///
/// Note that components are **NOT** represented by [`GenericNode`]. Instead, components are
/// _disappearing_, meaning that they are simply functions that generate [`GenericNode`]s inside a
/// new reactive context. This means that using components add minimal overhead.
///
/// Sycamore ships with 2 rendering backends out of the box:
/// * [`DomNode`] - Rendering in the browser (to real DOM nodes).
/// * [`SsrNode`] - Render to a static string (often on the server side for Server Side Rendering,
///   aka. SSR).
///
/// To implement your own rendering backend, you will need to create a new struct which implements
/// [`GenericNode`].
///
/// # Cloning
///
/// [`GenericNode`]s should be cheaply cloneable (usually backed by a [`Rc`](std::rc::Rc) or other
/// reference counted container) and preserve reference equality.
