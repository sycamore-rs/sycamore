//! Web renderer for the Sycamore UI framework.
//!
//! Sycamore on its own is a backend-agnostic UI framework. This crate provides web support to
//! Sycamore. With this crate, it is possible to render Sycamore views to the DOM (using
//! [`DomNode`]), "hydrate" existing DOM nodes (using [`HydrateNode`]), or render a static string
//! (using [`SsrNode`]).
//!
//! This crate is re-exported in the `sycamore` crate. It is recommended to use that instead of
//! using this crate directly.
