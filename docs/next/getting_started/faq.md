## I'm new to Rust. Where should I start?

If you are new to Rust, the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) would
be a good starting point. Sycamore uses quite a few Rust features such as
closures and smart pointers so be sure to get familiar with these topics.

## Why is Sycamore built with Rust?

Rust is a modern, safe, and fast language. Rust's strong type-system and
ownership model prevent all categories of bugs from memory bugs to logic bugs.
The compiler will catch most of your bugs before your app even runs! It is
therefore not surprising that Rust has been voted the most loved programming
language in Stack Overflow's Developer Survey for eight years in a row:

## Is there a router?

Yes. Sycamore has an official router that can be used to create SPAs with
optional support for SSR. Learn more about the router
[here](../advanced/routing).

## How do I get started with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

Check out the page on [SSR](../advanced/ssr) in the Sycamore Book.

## Is there a full-stack framework (like Next.js) for Sycamore?

Check out [Perseus](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus), a full-stack
framework for Sycamore developed by community member
[arctic-hen7](https://github.com/arctic-hen7). Perseus is full-featured,
supporting Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), i18n and
more.
