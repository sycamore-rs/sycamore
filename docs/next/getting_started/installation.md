# Getting Started

This documentation assumes the developer is already familiar with Rust programming. To learn more
about Rust, check out the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

## Install Rust

First, you'll need to install Rust. Follow the
[official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to get started.

You will also need the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed. This installs the necessary tools
to compile your code to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org).

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) and Rust edition

The minimum supported Rust toolchain is `v1.63.0`. Sycamore is not guaranteed to (and probably
won't) compile on older versions of Rust.

Sycamore only works on Rust edition 2021. Even though most crates written in edition 2021 are
backward compatible with older editions, this is not the case for Sycamore because Sycamore's
proc-macro generates code that is only compatible with edition 2021. Furthermore, the
[disjoint capture in closures](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/10/21/Rust-1.56.0.html#disjoint-capture-in-closures)
feature greatly improves the ergonomics when working with Sycamore's reactivity.

## Install Trunk

[Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) is the recommended build tool for Sycamore. If you are from JS land,
Trunk is like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) but specifically
tailored towards Rust + WASM apps.

You can use one of the following command to install Trunk on your system:

```bash
# Install via homebrew on Mac, Linux or Windows (WSL).
brew install trunk

# Install a release binary (great for CI).
# You will need to specify a value for ${VERSION}.
wget -qO- https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/releases/download/${VERSION}/trunk-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xzf-

# Install via cargo.
cargo install --locked trunk
```

For more information, head over to the [Trunk website](https://trunkrs.dev)

## Create a new Sycamore project

Create a new Rust project using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo new my-project
cd my-project
```

You now need to add Sycamore to your new project's dependencies. Add the following to your
`Cargo.toml` file in your project folder:

```toml
sycamore = "0.8.0"
```

> **Note**: Sycamore is currently being developed at a rapid pace. To have access to the latest
> features, consider using a
> [git dependency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories)
> instead.
>
> However, breaking changes are introduced all the time. It is therefore recommended to also specify
> a specific commit hash to prevent your code from randomly breaking. You can find the latest commit
> hash [here](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/commits/master) (to the right of each commit).
>
> ```toml
> # Make sure you update the rev to the latest commit hash.
> sycamore = { git = "https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore", rev = "fc640d313e66f9a6af422fae44f4f72fa86280cc" }
> ```

You should now be all set for your Sycamore adventure!
