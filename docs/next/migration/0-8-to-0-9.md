# Migration Guide: v0.8 to v0.9

> v0.9 is not yet stable and features have not yet been finalised. This
> migration guide may be incomplete and may change before the final v0.9
> release.

## Reactivity v3

Sycamore v0.9 introduces a brand-new reactivity system. Not only is the new
reactivity system faster than before, it is much nicer to use. The biggest
change is the removal of the explicit `cx: Scope` in favor of implicitly
tracking scopes through a global variable. This is just like v0.7, all the while
still keeping the ergonomics of `Copy`-able `Signal`s introduced in v0.8. This
change also means that we no longer have to deal with lifetimes! Instead,
everything is `'static`, allowing signals to be copied easily into global event
handlers among other things.

### No more `Scope`!

Migration should for the most part be quite systematic. A few global string
replacements should take care of the bulk of the work:

| Match            | Replacement  |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| `cx: Scope,`     | ` `          |
| `cx: Scope`      | ` `          |
| `cx,`            | ` `          |
| `cx`             | ` `          |
| `<'a,`           | `<`          |
| `<'a>`           | ` `          |
| `&'a Signal`     | `Signal`     |
| `&'a ReadSignal` | `ReadSignal` |

### No more `RcSignal`!

`RcSignal` has also been removed in favor of just using `Signal` which is now
`'static`. This can be migrated using the following:

| Match              | Replacement     |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| `RcSignal`         | `Signal`        |
| `create_rc_signal` | `create_signal` |

### Explicit `.get_clone()`

Another breaking change is that signals no longer automatically wrap their value
inside an `Rc`. This means that for a non-`Copy` value, you will either need to
clone the value or use the new helper method `.with(|value| ...)`.

### `nightly` only features

If you are using Rust nightly, you can enable the `nightly` feature on
`sycamore` to be able to access the signal value by simply calling it:

```rust
// Stable
let value = signal.get();
// Nightly only
let value = signal();
```

## View Backend v2

These pesky generics have been here since Syacmore v0.5 where we introduced SSR
support. Up until now, we have used generics to allow Sycamore apps to be
isomorphic, meaning that they can run on both the server and the client,
rendering to a string and to the DOM respectively.

However, adding generics to every single function that returns a `View` quickly
becomes tedious. No more! Now, Sycamore uses target detection to automatically
select the right rendering backend. If it detects that we are building for a
`wasm32` target, the DOM backend will automatically be used. Otherwise, the SSR
backend will be selected.

For updating your existing codebase, finding and replacing `"<G: Html>"` with
`""` (empty string) and `"View<G>"` with `"View"` should take care of most of
the cases.

### New builder syntax

All attributes are correctly type-checked now. This also reflects itself in the
builder API.

```rust
// Old
div()
    .c(h1()
        .t("Hello ")
        .dyn_if(
            move || !name.with(String::is_empty),
            move || span().dyn_t(move || name.get_clone()),
            move || span().t("World"),
        )
        .t("!"))
    .c(input().bind_value(name))
    .view();

// New
div()
    .children((
        h1().children((
            "Hello ",
            move || {
                if !name.with(String::is_empty) {
                    span().children(move || name.get_clone())
                } else {
                    span().children("World")
                }
            },
            "!",
        )),
        input().bind(bind::value, name),
    ))
    .into();
```

Refer to the new docs for more information on the builder API syntax.

## Other small changes

### `iterable` renamed to `list` for `Indexed` and `Keyed`

```rust
// Old
view! {
    Indexed(
        iterable: ...,
        view: ...,
    )
}
// New
view! {
    Indexed(
        list: ...,
        view: ...,
    )
}
```

In addition, `list` now accepts static `Vec`s as well so no need creating a
dummy signal when using `Indexed`/`Keyed`:

```rust
// Old
view! {
    Indexed(
        list: *create_signal(vec![...]),
        view: ...,
    )
}
// New
view! {
    Indexed(
        list: vec![...],
        view: ...,
    )
}
```

### `ref` renamed to `r#ref`, `type` renamed to `r#type`

Since everything is based on the builder API now, the `view!` macro no longre
special cases `ref` and `type`. Instead, use `r#ref` and `r#type`. All other
identifiers that are Rust keywords should now be prepended with `r#`.
