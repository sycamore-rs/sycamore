# Sycamore Router

Routers are the backbone of SPAs (Single Page Apps). They handle displaying
different pages depending on the URL. When an anchor tag (`<a>`) is clicked, the
router will intercept it and navigate to the correct page without performing a
full refresh. This makes navigation feel faster and smoother.

## Adding `sycamore-router`

To add routing to your Sycamore app, install the
[`sycamore-router`](https://crates.io/crates/sycamore-router) crate from
crates.io.

```toml
sycamore-router = "0.9.2"
```

### Compatibility with `sycamore`

Note that the major version number for `sycamore-router` corresponds to the same
major version number for `sycamore` (e.g. `sycamore-router v0.5.x` is compatible
with `sycamore v0.5.x`).

## Creating routes

Start off by adding `use sycamore_router::{Route, Router, HistoryIntegration}` to the
top of your source code. This imports the symbols needed to define our router.

The heart of the router is an `enum`. Each variant of the `enum` represents a
different route. To make our `enum` usable with `Router`, we will use the
`Route` derive macro to implement the required traits for us. We will also derive the 
`Clone` trait which allows the contents to be copied by the router.

Here is an example:

```rust
#[derive(Route, Clone)]
enum AppRoutes {
    #[to("/")]
    Index,
    #[to("/about")]
    About,
    #[not_found]
    NotFound,
}
```

Note that each variant is marked with either the `#[to(_)]` or `#[not_found]`
attribute.

The `#[to(_)]` attribute designates a route. For example, `#[to("/about")]`
designates the route for the about page.

The `#[not_found]` is a fallback route. It is the route that matches when all
the other routes don't. There must be one, and only one route marked with
`#[not_found]`. Forgetting the not found route will cause a compile error.

## Routes syntax

### Static routes

The simplest routes are static routes. We already have the `"/"` and `"/about"`
routes in our above example which are both static.

Static routes can also be nested, e.g. `"/my/nested/path"`.

### Dynamic parameters

Path parameters can be dynamic by using angle brackets around a variable name in
the route's path. This will allow any segment to match the route in that
position.

For example, to match any route with `"hello"` followed by a name, we could use:

```rust
#[to("/hello/<name>")]
Hello {
    name: String,
}
```

The `<name>` parameter is _captured_ by the `name` field in the `Hello` variant.
For example, if we were to visit `/hello/sycamore`, we would find

```rust
AppRoutes::Hello { name: "sycamore".to_string() }
```

Multiple dynamic parameters are allowed. For example, the following route...

```rust
#[to("/repo/<org>/<name>")]
Repo {
    org: String,
    name: String,
}
```

...would match `/repo/sycamore-rs/sycamore` with a value of

```rust
AppRoutes::Repo {
    org: "sycamore-rs".to_string(),
    name: "sycamore".to_string(),
}
```

### Dynamic segments

Dynamic segments can also be captured using the `<param..>` syntax.

For example, the following route will match `"page"` followed by an arbitrary
number of segments (including 0 segments).

```rust
#[to("/page/<path..>")]
Page {
    path: Vec<String>,
}
```

Dynamic segments match lazily, meaning that once the next segment can be
matched, the capture will be completed. For example, the following route will
**not** capture the final `end` segment.

```rust
#[to("/start/<path..>/<end>")]
Path {
    path: Vec<String>,
    end: String,
}
```

### Unit variants

Enum unit variants are also supported. The following route has the same behavior
as the hello example from before.

```rust
#[to("/hello/<name>")]
Hello(String)
```

### Capture types

Capture variables are not limited to `String`. In fact, any type that implements
the
[`TryFromParam`](https://docs.rs/sycamore-router/latest/sycamore_router/trait.TryFromParam.html)
trait can be used as a capture.

This trait is automatically implemented for types that already implement
`FromStr`, which includes many standard library types.

Because `TryFromParam` is fallible, the route will only match if the parameter
can be parsed into the corresponding type.

For example, `/account/123` will match the following route but `/account/abc`
will not.

```rust
#[to("/account/<id>")]
Account { id: u32 }
```

Likewise, the
[`TryFromSegments`](https://docs.rs/sycamore-router/latest/sycamore_router/trait.TryFromSegments.html)
trait is the equivalent for dynamic segments.

### Nested routes

Routes can also be nested! The following code will route any url to `/route/..`
to `Nested`.

```rust
#[derive(Route, Clone)]
enum Nested {
    #[to("/nested")]
    Nested,
    #[not_found]
    NotFound,
}

#[derive(Route, Clone)]
enum Admin {
    #[to("/console")]
    Console,
    #[not_found]
    NotFound,
}

#[derive(Route, Clone)]
enum Routes {
    #[to("/")]
    Home,
    #[to("/route/<_..>")]
    NestedRoute(Nested),
    #[to("/admin/<_..>")]
    AdminRoute(Admin),
    #[not_found]
    NotFound,
}
```

## Using `Router`

To display content based on the route that matches, we can use a `Router`.

```rust
view! {
    Router(
        integration=HistoryIntegration::new(),
        view=|route: ReadSignal<AppRoutes>| {
            view! {
                div(class="app") {
                    (match route.get_clone() {
                        AppRoutes::Index => view! {
                            "This is the index page"
                        },
                        AppRoutes::About => view! {
                            "About this website"
                        },
                        AppRoutes::NotFound => view! {
                            "404 Not Found"
                        },
                    })
                }
            }
        }
    )
}
```

`Router` is just a component like any other. The props accept a closure taking a
`ReadSignal` of the matched route as a parameter and an "integration". The
integration is for adapting the router to different environments (e.g.
server-side rendering). The `HistoryIntegration` is a built-in integration that
uses the
[HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API).

Any clicks on anchor tags (`<a>`) created inside the `Router` will be
intercepted and handled by the router.

## Server-side rendering and `StaticRouter`

Whereas `Router` is used inside the context of a browser, `StaticRouter` can be
used for SSR.

The difference between a `Router` and a `StaticRouter` is that the route is
provided to `StaticRouter` during the initialization phase. The initial route is
provided as an argument to `StaticRouterProps::new`.

This is so that `StaticRouter` can return a `View` immediately without blocking
to wait for the route preload. The route is expected to be resolved separately
using the `Route::match_path` function.

```rust
let route = AppRoutes::match_path(path);

view! {
    StaticRouter(
        route=route,
        view=|route: ReadSignal<AppRoutes>| {
            view! {
                div(class="app") {
                    (match route.get_clone() {
                        AppRoutes::Index => view! {
                            "This is the index page"
                        },
                        AppRoutes::About => view! {
                            "About this website"
                        },
                        AppRoutes::NotFound => view! {
                            "404 Not Found"
                        },
                    })
                }
            }
        }
    )
}
```

## Using `navigate`

Calling `navigate` navigates to the specified `url`. The url should have the
same origin as the app.

This is useful for imperatively navigating to an url when using an anchor tag
(`<a>`) is not possible/suitable (e.g. when submitting a form).

## `rel="external"`

By default, the router will intercept all `<a>` elements that have the same
origin as the current page. Sometimes, we just want the browser to handle
navigation without being intercepted by the router. To bypass the router, we can
add the `rel="external"` attribute to the anchor tag.

```rust
view! {
    a(href="path", rel="external") { "Path" }
}
```
