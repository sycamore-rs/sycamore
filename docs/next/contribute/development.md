## Using your local dev machine

To install and work on Sycamore locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore
cd sycamore
```

## Testing

To run unit tests and non Wasm integration tests, use:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run integration tests in the browser, you will need to have
[wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) installed:

```bash
wasm-pack test sycamore --firefox # or --chrome
```

If you want to run the tests in a headless browser, pass the `--headless` flag as well.

## PR Requirements

Before your PR can be merged, we ask that your code is properly formatted using `cargo fmt` and
passes `cargo clippy`.

If your code introduces new functionality, we also ask you to write some unit tests and eventually
some integration tests.

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Sycamore!
