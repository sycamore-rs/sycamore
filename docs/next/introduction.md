# Introduction

This book will help you get started with
[Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore), a library that makes it
effortless to write performant user interfaces using the power of fine-grained
reactivity. Sycamore uses open web standards such as
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) to run your Rust code on the web, an
environment that has been traditionally dominated by JavaScript. We are also
looking at other environments for running Sycamore (such as TUI, or native) but
these efforts are currently exploratory.

This document assumes a basic knowledge of [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). If you
are not yet familiar with Rust, there are many great resources available such as
the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). For more information
abut Rust, check out the
[official "Learn Rust" page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn).

With that out of the way, let's get started with Sycamore!
