# Styling

Styling is definitely important for a modern web app. Sycamore is not opinionated when it comes to
styling and lets you use whichever method works best for you. Below are some common options.

TODO: Provide more details on current state of CSS in Sycamore.

## Raw CSS files

The simplest is just to use raw CSS files. This is very simple when using Trunk. For more
information, refer to [the Trunk docs](https://trunkrs.dev/assets/#css). Be sure to include the
`data-trunk` attribute in your <link> tag, otherwise Trunk will not serve it.

## CSS framework

Using a CSS framework is also definitely possible with Sycamore. Simply serve the framework's CSS
code using Trunk and you should be able to use the CSS classes like normal from your Sycamore code.

### Tailwind CSS

One particular kind of CSS frameworks worthy of note are utility-first CSS frameworks (such as
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or [Windi CSS](https://windicss.org/)).
