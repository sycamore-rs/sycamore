# Routing

Routers are the backbone of SPAs (Single Page Apps). They handle displaying different pages
depending on the URL. When an anchor tag (`<a>`) is clicked, the router will intercept it and
navigate to the correct page without performing a full refresh. This makes navigation feel faster
and smoother.

## Adding `sycamore-router`

To add routing to your Sycamore app, install the
[`sycamore-router`](https://crates.io/crates/sycamore-router) crate from crates.io.

```toml
sycamore-router = "0.5.2"
```

### Compatibility with `sycamore`

Note that the major version number for `sycamore-router` corresponds to the same major version
number for `sycamore` (e.g. `sycamore-router v0.5.x` is compatible with `sycamore v0.5.x`).

## Creating routes

Start off by adding `use sycamore_router::{Route, Router, RouterProps}` to the top of your source
code. This imports the symbols needed to define our router.

The heart of the router is an `enum`. Each variant of the `enum` represents a different route. To
make our `enum` usable with `Router`, we will use the `Route` derive macro to implement the required
traits for us.

Here is an example:

```rust
#[derive(Route)]
enum AppRoutes {
    #[to("/")]
    Index,
    #[to("/about")]
    About,
    #[not_found]
    NotFound,
}
```

Note that each variant is marked with either the `#[to(_)]` or `#[not_found]` attribute.

The `#[to(_)]` attribute designates a route. For example, `#[to("/about")]` designates the route for
the about page.

The `#[not_found]` is a fallback route. It is the route that matches when all the other routes
don't. There must be one, and only one route marked with `#[not_found]`. Forgetting the not found
route will cause a compile error.

## Routes syntax

### Static routes

The simplest routes are static routes. We already have the `"/"` and `"/about"` routes in our above
example which are both static.

Static routes can also be nested, e.g. `"/my/nested/path"`.

#### Dynamic parameters

Path parameters can be dynamic by using angle brackets around a variable name in the route's path.
This will allow any segment to match the route in that position.

For example, to match any route with `"hello"` followed by a name, we could use:

```rust
#[to("/hello/<name>")]
Hello {
    name: String,
}
```

The `<name>` parameter is _captured_ by the `name` field in the `Hello` variant. For example, if we
were to visit `/hello/sycamore`, we would find

```rust
AppRoutes::Hello { name: "sycamore".to_string() }
```

Multiple dynamic parameters are allowed. For example, the following route...

```rust
#[to("/repo/<org>/<name>")]
Repo {
    org: String,
    name: String,
}
```

...would match `/repo/sycamore-rs/sycamore` with a value of

```rust
AppRoutes::Repo {
    org: "sycamore-rs".to_string(),
    name: "sycamore".to_string(),
}
```

### Dynamic segments

Dynamic segments can also be captured using the `<param..>` syntax.

For example, the following route will match `"page"` followed by an arbitrary number of segments
(including 0 segments).

```rust
#[to("/page/<path..>")]
Page {
    path: Vec<String>,
}
```

Dynamic segments match lazily, meaning that once the next segment can be matched, the capture will
be completed. For example, the following route will **not** capture the final `end` segment.

```rust
#[to("/start/<path..>/<end>")]
Path {
    path: Vec<String>,
}
```

#### Unit variants

Enum unit variants are also supported. The following route has the same behavior as the hello
example from before.

```rust
#[to("/hello/<name>")]
Hello(String)
```

#### Capture types

Capture variables are not limited to `String`. In fact, any type that implements the
[`FromParam`](https://docs.rs/sycamore-router/latest/sycamore_router/trait.FromParam.html) trait can
be used as a capture.

This trait is automatically implemented for types that already implement `FromStr`, which includes
many standard library types.

Because `FromParam` is fallible, the route will only match if the parameter can be parsed into the
corresponding type.

For example, `/account/123` will match the following route but `/account/abc` will not.

```rust
#[to("/account/<id>")]
Account { id: u32 }
```

Likewise, the
[`FromSegments`](https://docs.rs/sycamore-router/latest/sycamore_router/trait.FromSegments.html)
trait is the equivalent for dynamic segments.

## Using `Router`

To display content based on the route that matches, we can use a `Router`.

```rust
template! {
    Router(RouterProps::new(HistoryIntegration::new(), |route: AppRoutes| {
        match route {
            AppRoutes::Index => template! {
                "This is the index page"
            },
            AppRoutes::About => template! {
                "About this website"
            },
            AppRoutes::NotFound => template! {
                "404 Not Found"
            },
        }
    })
}
```

`Router` is just a component like any other. The props accept a closure taking the matched route as
a parameter and an "integration". The integration is for adapting the router to different
environments (e.g. server-side rendering). The `HistoryIntegration` is a built-in integration that
uses the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API).

Any clicks on anchor tags (`<a>`) created inside the `Router` will be intercepted and handled by the
router.

## Server-side rendering and `StaticIntegration`

Whereas `HistoryIntegration` is used inside the context of a browser, `StaticIntegration` can be
used for SSR.

The difference between a `HistoryIntegration` and a `StaticIntegration` is that the url is provided
to `StaticIntegration` during the initialization phase. The initial url is provided as an argument
to `StaticIntegration::new`.

```rust
template! {
    Router(StaticIntegration::new("/about"), |route: AppRoutes| {
        match route {
            AppRoutes::Index => template! {
                "This is the index page"
            },
            AppRoutes::About => template! {
                "About this website"
            },
            AppRoutes::NotFound => template! {
                "404 Not Found"
            },
        }
    })
}
```

## Integrations

TODO: docs for creating custom router integrations.

## Using `navigate`

Calling `navigate` navigates to the specified `url`. The url should have the same origin as the app.

This is useful for imperatively navigating to an url when using an anchor tag (`<a>`) is not
possible/suitable (e.g. when submitting a form).
