# CSS

TODO

CSS in Sycamore needs more design before anything can be implemented.

For now, though, you can use Trunk to serve CSS. See [the Trunk docs](https://trunkrs.dev/assets/#css) for more info. Be sure to include the `data-trunk` attibute in your <link> tag, otherwise Trunk will not serve it.
