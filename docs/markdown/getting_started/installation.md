# Getting Started

## Installing Rust

First, you'll need to install Rust. Follow the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to get started.

You will also need the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed:
```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Installing Trunk

[Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) is the recommended build tool for Maple.
You can use `cargo` to install Trunk:
```
cargo install trunk wasm-bindgen-cli
```
For more information, head over to the [Trunk website](https://trunkrs.dev)

You should now be all set for your Maple adventure!
