# Announcing Sycamore v0.9.0

I'm happy to announce the release of Sycamore v0.9.0. Sycamore is a reactive
Rust UI framework for building web apps using WebAssembly. This release is by
far the biggest Sycamore release we've ever had, with tons of new features and
improvements.

## A shinny new website

We now have a shinny new website along with a shinny new domain! The old website
had a bunch of issues such as buggy navigation, no server side rendering
support, and an awkward layout. This new website redesign fixes many of those
things.

We've also moved to a new domain: [sycamore.dev](https://sycamore.dev). This was
long overdue. We were previously using a Netlify subdomain so this change
hopefully makes Sycamore look more legitimate.

The old docs are still available at the old website but the index page will now
automatically redirect to the new website.
